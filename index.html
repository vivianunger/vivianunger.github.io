    <p>Hi. Welcome to my home page.</p>
	<p>I work as a <a href="indexing/indexing.html">freelance book indexer</a>. I'm also an electoral reform activist. My website on that topic is embarrassingly out of date, but I hope to fix that soon. It's at <a href="https://fairvoting4nb.wordpress.com/">https://fairvoting4nb.wordpress.com/</a>.</a>
	<p>Here's something that combines those two interests: my <a href="erre-report-index.html">pro-bono sample index</a> to the <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/ERRE/report-3/">ERRE Committe Report</a>.</p>
    <p>The ERRE Committe was the committee formed by Justin Trudeau in 2016 to study electoral reform.</p>
