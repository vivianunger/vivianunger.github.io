			<p>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Vivian’s index of <em>Too Dumb for Democracy?</em> is excellent. She broke down a complex subject into its essential parts and helped make the book accessible and, above all, <em>useful</em>.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;<br>
			&mdash;David Moscrop, Author</p>
			<p>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Thank you for your skilfully devised and very useful index—not easy for an edited volume especially!&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;<br>

			<a id="about"></a><h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I did my indexing training in 2016 and 2017, and landed my first professional project in 2018. The year after that, I won the <a href="http://www.certifiedindexers.com/">Purple Pen Award for New Indexers</a>.
			<p>Winners don't actually receive a purple pen, just $100 USD. However, <a href="https://indexers.ca/tag/purple-pen-competition/">this piece on Indexers.ca</a> shows me wearing a purple shirt. I don't think I did that intentionally; it was just one of my favourite shirts.</p>
			<p>My winning index was for <em><a href="https://www.davidmoscrop.com/my-book-1">Too Dumb for Democracy? Why We Make Bad Political Decisions and How We Can Make Better Ones</a></em> by <a href="https://www.davidmoscrop.com/">David Moscrop</a>. </p>
			<p>I was fortunate enough to meet David in person. I don't know how many Indexers have the opportunity to meet their authors, but he just happened to come to my city to give a lecture, probably because his publishing house was here. I now have an autographed copy of his book. He's a lovely man.
			<p>I have indexed scholarly, trade and children's books. I can do hyperlinked indexes for e-books as well as static indexes for print books. Lately I've been carving out a little niche for myself in <a href="indexing-embedded.html">embedded</a> <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> indexing. Very satisfying to my techie-geek side. I even wrote a few scripts in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> to help me do it.</p>
